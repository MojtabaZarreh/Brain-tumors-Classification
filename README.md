Gliomas are tumors that form in glial cells in the brain and spinal cord. They're usually cancerous. It's rare for gliomas to spread to other areas of your body. But they can grow quickly through the brain and spine and are life-threatening.

Meningiomas are tumors that develop from the membrane (meninges) that covers the brain and spinal cord. They are the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Most meningioma tumors (85-90%) are categorized as benign, with the remaining 10-15% being atypical meningioma or malignant meningioma (cancerous).

A pituitary tumor is a growth of abnormal cells in the tissues of the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland hormones control many other glands in the body. Having certain genetic conditions increases the risk of developing a pituitary tumor
